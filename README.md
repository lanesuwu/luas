# 🎮 LUA Scripts for CS:GO Cheats

Welcome to my personal collection of LUA scripts created for use with CS:GO These scripts were designed for customization, experimentation, and learning purposes, primarily intended for use with cheat frameworks like [gamesense/skeet](https://gamesense.pub/) or similar LUA-compatible cheat clients.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**  
> These scripts are for **educational and personal use only**. I do not condone or encourage cheating in online multiplayer games. Use at your own risk - you are solely responsible for any consequences (e.g., VAC bans, community bans, etc.).


## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Ensure your cheat client supports LUA scripting.
2. Clone this repo or download individual files.
3. Load the scripts in your cheat client’s LUA manager.

## 📌 Notes

- Scripts are written with readability and modularity in mind.
- No obfuscation used (obfuscation is lame) - feel free to learn, tweak, or fork.
- If you have suggestions, open an issue or PR.
